# Loops

## While Loop

A while loop is used when you want to perform a task indefinitely, until a particular condition is met. It’s a condition-controlled loop. 


```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/WhileLoop.png")
```



The loop will continue until the condition is `FALSE`. 


```{r}
x = 5

# If statement is true, keep running the loop 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
}
```


If the condition is false at the start, the while loop will never be executed at all.

```{r}
x = 0

# If statement starts as TRUE,  the loop will never run 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
}
```

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop.

```{r}
x = 5

# If statement starts as TRUE,  the loop will never run 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
  
  if(x == 2){
    print("Entered IF statement, stop loop")
    break 
  }
  
}
```

If not given an adequate stopping criteria or break statement the loop will continue forever. For example, if we started the above examples at `x = -2`. 


## For Loops
The `for` statement in `R` is a bit different from what you usually use in other programming languages. Rather than iterating over a numeric progression, `R`’s `for` statement iterates over the items of a vector or a list. The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the vector.


```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/ForLoop.png")
```



```{r}
# Iterate through a vector
colors = c("red","green","blue","yellow")

for (x in colors) {
  print(x)
}
```

```{r}
lst = list(3.14, "Hi", c(1,2,3))

for (i in lst) {
  print(i)
}
```

If you need to execute a group of statements for a specified number of times, use sequence operator : or built-in function `seq()`.

```{r}
# Print 'Hello!' 3 times
for (x in 1:3) {
  print("Hello!")
}
```


```{r}
for (x in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) {
  print(x^2)
}
```


Like the while loop, the `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop.

```{r}
colors = c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (x in colors) {
  if (x == "blue"){
       break 
  }
  print(x)
}
```

For loops do not have the same risk of "running forever", like while loops have. 




## Practice Problems {-} 

1) Create the function which has one arguement `n`.  Have this function generate the first n fibannaci numbers using a **while** loop.  Note that the Fibanacci sequence is formed by starting with the number 0, 1 and then adding the last two numbers to get the next number: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

2) Create the function which has one arguement `n`.  Have this function generate the first n fibannaci numbers using a **for** loop.  Note that the Fibanacci sequence is formed by starting with the number 0, 1 and then adding the last two numbers to get the next number: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

3) Create a function which has one argument `num`.  Have this function generate the factorial of this number using any iteration technique you would like.  Recall that a factorial of a number is product of all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1. For example, 4! (4 factorial) = 4(3)(2)(1) = 24

4) Write a function which has only one argument `n`.  Have this function display the `n` terms of odd natural number and their sum. 


**Answer 1**
```{r}
# Generate the first n fibannaci numbers

gen_fib = function(n){

  # Initiate the fib sequence 
  fib = c(0,1)
  current_n = length(fib)
  
  while(current_n<n){
    # Generate the next number 
    next_number = fib[c(current_n-1)] + fib[current_n]
    
    # Add new number 
    fib = c(fib, next_number)
    
    # Update the length 
    current_n = length(fib)
  }
  
  return(fib)
}
```



**Answer 2**

```{r}
# Generate the first n fibannaci numbers

gen_fib = function(n){

  # Initiate the fib sequence
  fib = c(0,1, rep(0, c(n-2)))
  
  for(index in 3:length(fib)){
    # Generate the next number 
    next_number = fib[c(index-2)] + fib[index-1]
    
    # Add new number 
    fib[index] = next_number
  }
  
  return(fib)
}
```



**Answer 3**

```{r}
my_factorial = function(num){
  my_answer = 1
  for(i in 1:num){
    my_answer = my_answer * i 
  }
  print(my_answer)
}
```


**Answer 4**
 
```{r}
odd_numbers = function(n){
    odd_vector = NA
  
  for(i in 1:n){
    odd_vector[i] = 2*i - 1
  }
    
 return_me = list(vector = odd_vector, 
                  the_sum = sum(odd_vector))
 return(return_me)
}

odd_numbers(5)

```
