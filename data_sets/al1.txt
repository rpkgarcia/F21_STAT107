If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those\
offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having\
 continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He\
 gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by\
 whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those\
 divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?\
 Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may\
 speedily pass away.  Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth\
 piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall\
 be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by\
 another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still\
 it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous\
 altogether\'94.}
