"],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to R 1.1 The RStudio Interface 1.2 R Objects", " Chapter 1 Introduction to R This section was written primarily by Dr. Robert Desharnais (2020), and was modified for our course. I am grateful for his help. 1.1 The RStudio Interface We will begin by looking at the RStudio software interface. Refer to Figure 1 as you follow the instructions below. Launch RStudio. You will see a window that looks like Fig. 1. There are four panels of the window: The R Command Console is where you type R commands for immediate execution. The Notebook in the upper left portion of the window is an area for editing R source code for scripts and functions and for viewing R data frame objects. New tabs will be added as new R code files and data objects are opened. The Notebook in the upper right portion of the window is an area for browsing the variables in the R workspace environment and the R command line history. The Notebook in the lower right portion of the window has several tabs. The Files tab is an area for browsing the files in the current working directory. The Plot tab is for viewing graphics produced using R commands. The Packages tab lists the R packages available. Other packages can be loaded. The Help tab provides access to the R documentation. The Viewer tab is for viewing local web content in the temporary session directory (not files on the web). Bottom Left Pane Let’s begin with the Console. This is where you type R commands for immediate execution. Click in the Command Console, “&gt;” symbol is the system prompt. You should see a blinking cursor that tells you the console is the current focus of keyboard input. Type: 1+2 ## [1] 3 The result tells you that the line begins with the first (and only) element of the result which is the number 3. You can also execute R’s built-in functions (or functions you add). Type the following command. exp(pi) ## [1] 23.14069 In R, “pi” is a special constant to represent the number and “exp” is the exponential function. The result tells you that the first (and only) element of the result is the number \\(e^{\\pi}=\\) 23.14069. Bottom Right Pane Now let’s look at the Files tab of the notebook at the lower right of the window. Every R session has a working directory where R looks for and saves files. It is a good practice to create a different directory for every project and make that directory the working directory. For example, let’s make a new directory called MyDirectory. (You can chose another name if you wish). Click on the Files tab of the notebook. You should see a listing of files in your default working directory. Click on the small button with an ellipsis image on the right side of the file path above the directory listing. Navigate to the folder where you want to create the new directory and click the OK button. Click on the New Folder button just below the Files tab (see right). Type MyDirectory in the panel that opens click on the folder in the Notebook. Click the More button to the right of the New Folder button and select the menu option Set as Working Directory. This new folder is now the working directory for the current R session. This menu option is a short cut for a command that was automatically entered into the R console. Top Right Pane Next we will look at the R environment, also called the R workspace. This is where you can see the names and other information on the variables that were created during your R session and are available for use in other commands. In the R console type: a = 29.325 b = log(a) c = a/b Look at the Environment pane. The variables a, b, and c are now part of your R work space. You can reuse those variables as part of other commands. In the R console type: v= c(a, b, c) v ## [1] 29.325000 3.378440 8.680041 The variable v is a vector created using the concatenate function c(). (The concatenate should not be confused with the variable c that was created earlier. Functions are always followed by parentheses that contain the function arguments.) This function combines its arguments into a vector or list. Look at the Environment panel. The text num [1:3] tells us that the variable v is a vector with elements v[1], v[2], and v[3]. Top Left Pane Now let’s look at the R viewer notebook. This panel can be used to data which are data frame objects or matrix objects in R. We will begin by taking advantage of a data frame object that was built into R for demonstration purposes. We will copy it into a data frame object. In the R console, type: df = mtcars Let’s view the data. On the right side of the entry for the df object is a button we can use to view the entries of the data frame (see green arrow below). Click on the View Button. If your look in the notebook area in the upper left portion of the window, you can see a spreadsheet-like view of the data. This is for viewing only; you cannot edit the data. Use the scroll bars to view the data entries. You can also list the data in the console by typing the name of the data fame object: df ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 The columns are labeled with the names of the variables and the rows are labeled with the names of each car. Each row represents the data values for one car; that is, each row is one observation. 1.2 R Objects At its core, R is an objected-oriented computational and programming environment. Everything in R is an object belonging to a certain class. Rcan represent different types of data. The types include numeric, integer, complex, logical, and character. We will look at some examples. Numbers There are different types of numeric objects. Specifically, we will first consider real numbers (can have decimal values) and integers. We can examine how R stores these types of numbers using the class() function. We will begin with decimal numbers. a = 17.45 a ## [1] 17.45 class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; b = 5 b ## [1] 5 class(b) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Both the variables a and b are numeric objects. When you type a number R will default to treating it as a numeric object which allows decimals. You can use the as.integer() function to create a variable that is specifically an integer number. a = as.integer(a) a ## [1] 17 class(a) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; b = as.integer(b) b ## [1] 5 class(b) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Logical Logical values are either “true” or “false” and are created by logical statements that compare variables. There are several ways to do logical statements. To check if two values or objects are equal to each other we use “==”. To see if a value/object is greater than or less than another we use the “&lt;”, “&gt;”, “&lt;=”, or “&gt;=”. b = 5 2+3 == b ## [1] TRUE n = (10&lt;11) n ## [1] TRUE class(n) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; e = (b &gt;10) class(e) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; The symbols “&amp;” “|”, and “!” are used for the logical operations “and”, “or”, and “not”. Two logical expressions connected by &amp; (and) are true only if both are true. Two logical expressions connected by | (or) are true if either are true. The ! (not) operation turns a true into a false and vice-versa. e &amp; n ## [1] FALSE e | n ## [1] TRUE !n ## [1] FALSE Character Character values are text. They are often used as data values and labels. first = &quot;George&quot; first ## [1] &quot;George&quot; class(first) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; last = &quot;Washington&quot; last ## [1] &quot;Washington&quot; class(last) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; There are several functions that can operate on character strings. full = paste(first, last) full ## [1] &quot;George Washington&quot; nchar(full) ## [1] 17 tolower(full) ## [1] &quot;george washington&quot; toupper(full) ## [1] &quot;GEORGE WASHINGTON&quot; The function paste() concatenates two or more character strings with a separator, which is a space by default. The function nchar() returns the number of characters in a string. The functions tolower() and toupper() changes any upper case characters to lower case and vice-versa. Vectors All the objects we have created this far are single element vectors. R is a vectorized language, meaning most of the procedures, functions, and operations have been optimized to work with vectors. It is often advantageous to utilize this feature. A vector is a one dimensional array of the same data type. We can use the concatenate function, c(), to create vectors, and to make a vector larger. v1 = c(19, 390.3, pi, -32.1) v1 ## [1] 19.000000 390.300000 3.141593 -32.100000 class(v1) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; v2 = c(1.1, 6, -9.4, 32.1) v2 ## [1] 1.1 6.0 -9.4 32.1 class(v2) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; v3 = c(v1, first) class(v3) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; v4 = c(first, last) class(v4) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; The length() function can be used to obtain the number of elements in a vector. length(v1) ## [1] 4 Vectors can be used in arithmetic computations. If the two vectors are of the same length, the computations are performed element-by-element. v1 + v2 ## [1] 20.100000 396.300000 -6.258407 0.000000 v1 * v2 ## [1] 20.90000 2341.80000 -29.53097 -1030.41000 Single numbers (scalars) will operate on all the vector elements in an expression. 5*v1 ## [1] 95.00000 1951.50000 15.70796 -160.50000 v1/3 ## [1] 6.333333 130.100000 1.047198 -10.700000 Individual elements of a vector can be obtained using an index in square brackets. A negative index removes that element from the vector. The v2[-1] is the vector v2 with the first element removed. The concatenate function can be used to obtain two or more elements of a vector in any desired order. Here v1[c(3,2)] returns the third and second elements of the vector v1. v1[3] ## [1] 3.141593 v2[-1] ## [1] 6.0 -9.4 32.1 v3[c(3,2)] ## [1] &quot;3.14159265358979&quot; &quot;390.3&quot; 1.2.1 Factors Matrices A matrix is a two dimensional array of data of the same type. The matrix function, matrix(), can be used to create a new matrix. m = matrix(c(1, 9, 2, 0, 5, 7, 3, 8, 4), nrow=3, ncol=3) m ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 3 ## [2,] 9 5 8 ## [3,] 2 7 4 R labels the rows and columns for us in the output. The matrix is filled column-by-column using the elements of the vector created by the concatenate function. As with vectors, matrices can be used in arithmetic expressions with scalars and other matrices of the same size. m2 = m/2 m2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.5 0.0 1.5 ## [2,] 4.5 2.5 4.0 ## [3,] 1.0 3.5 2.0 m *m2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.5 0.0 4.5 ## [2,] 40.5 12.5 32.0 ## [3,] 2.0 24.5 8.0 Indices can be used to obtain the elements of a matrix, but now we must consider both the row and column. m[2,2] ## [1] 5 m[c(1,3), c(1,3)] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 3 ## [2,] 2 4 m[2,] ## [1] 9 5 8 m[,3] ## [1] 3 8 4 Some functions are particularly useful when using matrices. For instance, t(), dim(), and c(). The transpose function, t(), switches the column and rows of a matrix. The dimension function, dim(), returns the dimensions (number of rows, columns) of a matrix. The concatenate function, c(), turns a matrix into a vector by concatenating the columns of the matrix. Data Frames Like a matrix, a data frame is a rectangular array of values where each column is a vector, However, unlike a matrix, the columns can be different data types. We can create a set of vectors of the same length and use the data.frame() function to make a data frame object. age = c(25,37,23) gender = c(&quot;Male&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;) married = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) friends = data.frame(age, gender, married) friends ## age gender married ## 1 25 Male FALSE ## 2 37 Male TRUE ## 3 23 Female FALSE Each column is given the name of the vector used to define it. The data type of the three columns are numeric, character, and logical. There are a few functions that are particularly useful when working with data frames. The functions nrow() and ncol() return the number of rows and columns. The function rownames() and colnames() can be used to change the row and column names. dim(friends) ## [1] 3 3 nrow(friends) ## [1] 3 ncol(friends) ## [1] 3 rownames(friends) = c(&quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;) friends ## age gender married ## Doug 25 Male FALSE ## Juan 37 Male TRUE ## Mary 23 Female FALSE We can refer to a data frame element using a row and column number or name. friends[2,3] ## [1] TRUE friends[&quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;married&quot;] ## [1] TRUE We can also subset an individual columns using the ‘$’ symbol and specifying the column name. friends$age ## [1] 25 37 23 Lists References "],["more-on-objects.html", "Chapter 2 More On Objects", " Chapter 2 More On Objects Factors In real-world problems, you often encounter data that can be classified in categories. For example, suppose a survey was conducted of a group of seven individuals, who were asked to identify their hair color and gender. Name Hair Color Gender Amy Blonde Female Bob Black Male Eve Black Female Kim Red Female Max Blonde Male Ray Brown Male Sam Black Male Here, the hair color and gender are the examples of categorical data. To store such categorical data, R has a special data structure called factors. A factor is an ordered collection of items. The different values that the factor can take are called levels. In R, you can create a factor with the factor() function. hcolors = c(&quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;) f = factor(hcolors) f ## [1] Blonde Black Black Red Blonde Brown Black ## Levels: Black Blonde Brown Red A factor looks like a vector, but it has special properties. Levels are one of them. Notice that when you print the factor, R displays the distinct levels below the factor. R keeps track of all the possible values in a vector, and each value is called a level of the associated factor.The levels() function shows all the levels from a factor. gender = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;) f = factor(gender) levels(f) ## [1] &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Male&quot; f ## [1] Female Male Female Female Male Male Male ## Levels: Female Male If your vector contains only a subset of all the possible levels, then R will have an incomplete picture of the possible levels. Consider the following example of a vector consisting of directions: directions = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;East&quot;) f = factor(directions) f ## [1] North West North East North West East ## Levels: East North West Notice that the levels of your new factor do not contain the value “South”. So, R thinks that North, West, and East are the only possible levels. However, in practice, it makes sense to have all the possible directions as levels of your factor. To add all the possible levels explicitly, you specify the levels argument of the function factor(). directions = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;East&quot;) f = factor(directions, levels = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;)) f ## [1] North West North East North West East ## Levels: North East South West R lets you assign abbreviated names for the levels. You can do this by specifying the labels argument of factor(). directions = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;) f = factor(directions, levels = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;), labels = c(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;W&quot;)) f ## [1] N W S E W N S ## Levels: N E S W Sometimes data has some kind of natural order between elements. For example, sports analysts use a three-point scale to determine how well a sports team is competing: loss &lt; tie &lt; win. In market research, it’s very common to use a five point scale to measure perceptions: strongly disagree &lt; disagree &lt; neutral &lt; agree &lt; strongly agree. Such kind of data that is possible to place in order or scale is known as Ordinal data. In R, there is a special data type for ordinal data. This type is called ordered factors. To create an ordered factor, use the factor() function with the argument ordered=TRUE. record = c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f = factor(record, ordered = TRUE) f ## [1] win tie loss tie loss win win ## Levels: loss &lt; tie &lt; win You can also reverse the order of levels using the rev() function. record = c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f = factor(record, ordered = TRUE, levels = rev(levels(f))) f ## [1] win tie loss tie loss win win ## Levels: win &lt; tie &lt; loss If you have no observations in one of the levels, you can drop it using the droplevels() function. record = c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f = factor(record, levels = c(&quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;win&quot;)) f ## [1] win loss loss win loss win ## Levels: loss tie win droplevels(f) ## [1] win loss loss win loss win ## Levels: loss win The summary() function will give you a quick overview of the contents of a factor. gender = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;) f = factor(gender) summary(f) ## Female Male ## 3 4 The function table() tabulates observations. table(f) ## f ## Female Male ## 3 4 Lists A list is an array of objects. Unlike vectors and matrices, the objects can belong to different classes. Lists are useful for packaging together a set of related objects. We can create a list of objects in our workspace by using the list() function. lst = list(1, 2, 3) # A list of characters lst = list(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) # A list of mixed datatypes lst = list(1, &quot;abc&quot;, 1.23, TRUE) The best way to understand the contents of a list is to use the structure function str(). It provides a compact display of the internal structure of a list. lst = list(1, &quot;abc&quot;, 1.23, TRUE) str(lst) ## List of 4 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : chr &quot;abc&quot; ## $ : num 1.23 ## $ : logi TRUE A list can contain sublists, which in turn can contain sublists themselves, and so on. This is known as nested list or recursive vectors. lst = list(1, 3, &quot;abc&quot;, list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), TRUE) str(lst) ## List of 5 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : chr &quot;abc&quot; ## $ :List of 3 ## ..$ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## ..$ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## ..$ : chr &quot;c&quot; ## $ : logi TRUE There are two ways to extract elements from a list: Using [[]] gives you the element itself. Using [] gives you a list with the selected elements You can use [] to extract either a single element or multiple elements from a list. However, the result will always be a list. # extract 2nd element lst[2] ## [[1]] ## [1] 3 # extract 5th element lst[5] ## [[1]] ## [1] TRUE # select 1st, 3rd and 5th element lst[c(1,3,5)] ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;abc&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] TRUE # exclude 1st, 3rd and 5th element lst[c(-1,-3,-5)] ## [[1]] ## [1] 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [[2]][[1]] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; ## ## [[2]][[2]] ## [1] &quot;b&quot; ## ## [[2]][[3]] ## [1] &quot;c&quot; You can use [[]] to extract only a single element from a list. Unlike [], [[]] gives you the element itself. # extract 2nd element lst[[2]] ## [1] 3 # extract 5th element lst[[5]] ## [1] TRUE You can’t use logical vectors or negative numbers as indices when using [[]]. The difference between [] and [[]] is really important for lists, because [[]] returns the element itself while [] returns a list with the selected elements. The difference becomes clear when we inspect the structure of the output – one is a character and the other one is a list. lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) class(lst[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(lst[1]) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; Each list element can have a name. You can access individual element by specifying its name in double square brackets [[]] or use $ operator. months = list(JAN=1, FEB=2, MAR=3, APR=4) # extract element by its name months[[&quot;MAR&quot;]] ## [1] 3 # same as above but using the $ operator months$MAR ## [1] 3 # extract multiple elements months[c(&quot;JAN&quot;,&quot;APR&quot;)] ## $JAN ## [1] 1 ## ## $APR ## [1] 4 You can access individual items in a nested list by using the combination of [[]] or $ operator and the [] operator. lst = list(item1 = 3.14, item2 = list(item2a = 5:10, item2b = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;))) # preserve the output as a list lst[[2]][1] ## $item2a ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 # same as above but simplify the output lst[[2]][[1]] ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 # same as above with names lst[[&quot;item2&quot;]][[&quot;item2a&quot;]] ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 # same as above with $ operator lst$item2$item2a ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 # extract individual element lst[[2]][[2]][3] ## [1] &quot;c&quot; Modifying a list element is pretty straightforward. You use either the [[]] or the $ to access that element, and simply assign a new value. # Modify 3rd list element lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) lst[[3]] = 1 str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : num 1 ## $ : chr &quot;d&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;e&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;f&quot; You can modify components using [] as well, but you have to assign a list of components. # Modify 3rd list element using [] lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) lst[3] = list(1) str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : num 1 ## $ : chr &quot;d&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;e&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;f&quot; Using [] allows you to modify more than one component at once. # Modify first three list elements lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) lst[1:3] = list(1,2,3) str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : chr &quot;d&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;e&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;f&quot; You can use same method for modifying elements and adding new one. If the element is already present in the list, it is updated else, a new element is added to the list. # Add elements to a list lst = list(1, 2, 3) lst[[4]] = 4 str(lst) ## List of 4 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : num 4 By using append() method you can append one or more elements to the list. # Add more than one element to a list lst = list(1, 2, 3) lst = append(lst,c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;c&quot; To remove a list element, select it by position or by name, and then assign NULL to it. # Remove element from list lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) lst[[3]] = NULL str(lst) ## List of 4 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;d&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;e&quot; Using [], you can delete more than one component at once. # Remove multiple elements at once lst = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) lst[1:4] = NULL str(lst) ## List of 1 ## $ : chr &quot;e&quot; By using a logical vector, you can remove list elements based on the condition. # Remove all negative list elements lst = list(-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4) lst[lst &lt;= 0] = NULL str(lst) ## List of 4 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : num 4 The c() does a lot more than just creating vectors. It can be used to combine lists into a new list as well. lst1 = list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) lst2 = list(1,2,3) lst = c(lst1, lst2) str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;c&quot; ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 Basic statistical functions work on vectors but not on lists. For example, you cannot directly compute the mean of list of numbers. In that case, you have to flatten the list into a vector using unlist() first and then compute the mean of the result. lst = list(5, 10, 15, 20, 25) mean(unlist(lst)) ## [1] 15 To find the length of a list, use length() function. length(lst) ## [1] 5 "],["working-with-data-sets.html", "Chapter 3 Working with Data Sets 3.1 Loading Data Sets 3.2 Basic Data Manipulation", " Chapter 3 Working with Data Sets Here let me add some text.

To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
