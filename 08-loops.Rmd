# Loops {#loops}
Loops are another type of control flow structure.  They dictate how many times a series of commands should be run.  There are two type of loops, a `while` loop and a `for` loop.  These two loops operate similarly and are found in other programming languages such as `C` and `Python`. 


## While Loop

A `while` loop is used when you want to perform a task indefinitely, until a particular condition is met. It’s a condition-controlled loop. 


```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/WhileLoop.png")
```

The loop will continue until the condition is `FALSE`. 


```{r}
x = 5

# If statement is true, keep running the loop 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
}
```


If the condition is false at the start, the while loop will never be executed at all.

```{r}
x = 0

# If statement starts as TRUE,  the loop will never run 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
}
```


## For Loops
The `for` statement in R is a bit different from what you usually use in other programming languages. Rather than iterating over a numeric progression, R’s `for` statement iterates over the items of a vector or a list. The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the vector.


```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/ForLoop.png")
```



```{r}
# Iterate through a vector
colors = c("red","green","blue","yellow")

for (x in colors) {
  print(x)
}
```

```{r}
lst = list(3.14, "Hi", c(1,2,3))

for (i in lst) {
  print(i)
}
```

If you need to execute a group of statements for a specified number of times, use sequence operator : or built-in function `seq()`.

```{r}
# Print 'Hello!' 3 times
for (x in 1:3) {
  print("Hello!")
}
```


```{r}
for (x in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) {
  print(x^2)
}
```


## Break 

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop.

```{r}
x = 5

# If statement starts as TRUE,  the loop will never run 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
  
  if(x == 2){
    print("Entered IF statement, stop loop")
    break 
  }
  
}
```

**If not given an adequate stopping criteria or break statement the loop will continue forever.** For example, if we started the above examples at `x = -2`. The `break` statement is particularly important for the `while` loop. 


The `break` statement can also be used in a `for` loop. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop.

```{r}
colors = c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (x in colors) {
  if (x == "blue"){
       break 
  }
  print(x)
}
```

The `for` loops do not have the same risk of "running forever", like `while` loops have. 

## Next 

We can also use the `next` command in both `for` loops and `while` loops in order to skip executing a command. 



```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  
  i = i^2
  
  if(i <5){
    next
  }
  
  print(i)
}
```

The code inside the loop will run until it reaches the `next` statement.  Once 

## Nested Loops

We can also create loops within loops.  We refer to creating loops within other loops as a nested loop. 


```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  for(j in 1:3){
    statement = paste("i=", i, ", j=", j)
    print(statement)
  }
}
```

Here is an example of a nested loop which changes the elements of matrix to be the product of the row and column location. 

```{r}
my_matrix = matrix(NA, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for(i in 1:nrow(my_matrix)){
  for(j in 1:nrow(my_matrix)){
    my_matrix[i,j] = i*j
  }
}

my_matrix
```
